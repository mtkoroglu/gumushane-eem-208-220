<p align="justify">Differentiation is the operation of transforming one mathematical function to another, called the derivative. The derivative tells the slope, or the rate of change, of the original function. For example, if we have a function $f(x)=x^2$, its derivative is a function that tells us the rate of change of this function at . The rate of change is defined as:</p>

```math
f'(x) = \frac{f(x+\delta x)-f(x)}{\delta x}
```

for a small quantity $\delta x$.
